# Sooper Tooder

Democratizing education for everyone.

## Inspiration
Currently, the process of finding and connecting with a tutor/tutee is largely through word of mouth or tutoring organizations. While tutoring organizations will often take a portion of a tutor's rate, the alternative of being an independent tutor can be difficult to find clients without pre-existing connections. Furthermore, from the students perspective, it's hard to determine what the 'right' price to pay is for a tutor, as they can range from $20-100/h. Through our project, we hope to address these challenges and facilitate easier connections between students and educators. Sooper Tooder (prounounced Super Tutor) is here to bridge that gap to empower educators and learners.

## What it does
With personalized login flow and feed, Sooper Tooder is tailored to all educators and learners from democratizing the educational landscape to inspiring an online community of teaching talent. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) technology, our platform aims to provide personalized feedback for both students and teachers through a mobile application.
